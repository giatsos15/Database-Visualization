# Data Visualization Project

This repository contains a programming exercise (project) for the course "Advanced Topics in Technology and Database Foundations" during the academic year 2020-2021. The focus of the project is on data visualization, aiming to provide users with information in a visually insightful manner, highlighting properties, trends, and patterns concealed within the data.

## Project Goal

The primary objective of this project is the effective utilization of large datasets, presenting them interactively and engagingly for users.

## Advanced Topics in Technology and Database Foundations

This project aligns with advanced topics in technology and database foundations, addressing the challenges associated with data visualization.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Run Python Script**: Execute the Python script `main.py`, located in `src/createAndLoadfolder`.

2. **Setup Flask enviroment**: Setup and run flask application, located in `src/dataVisualization`.

## Usage

To interact with this data visualization project, follow the steps below:

1. **Select Indicators**: Choose the specific data indicators you want to visualize. This step allows you to focus on the aspects of the data that interest you the most.

2. **Choose Year Duration**: Specify the time frame or duration of the data you wish to explore. This feature enables you to analyze trends and patterns over a specific period.

3. **Pick Chart Type**: Select the type of chart or visualization that best suits your analysis. Tailor the presentation to enhance your understanding of the data, whether through bar charts, line graphs, or other visualization forms.

4. **View Results**: After making your selections, the project will generate an interactive visualization, highlighting the chosen indicators and time frame. Explore the results to gain insights into the underlying properties of the data.

Feel free to experiment with different combinations of indicators, durations, and chart types to uncover meaningful information from the dataset.

## Technologies Used

List of technologies and tools used in this project:

- **Flask:**
  - Flask is a micro web framework written in Python.
  - It is lightweight and modular, making it suitable for developing small to medium-sized web applications.
  - Flask provides the essentials for building web applications without imposing too much structure.

- **MySQL:**
  - MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).
  - It is widely used for storing and retrieving data in various types of applications, including web applications.
  - MySQL supports SQL (Structured Query Language) for managing and manipulating the data stored in databases.


# Data
